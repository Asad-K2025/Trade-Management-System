# Trade Management System

A database driven Trade Management System built with Microsoft Access to manage markets, transactions, pricing, and user authentication.  

This project demonstrates practical database design, query handling, and form based UI development.

## Features

- User authentication with hashed password storage
- Market creation and management
- Transaction recording and tracking
- Price management and updates
- Query based data retrieval using Access and SQL

## Tech Stack

- Microsoft Access
- VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)
- SQL (built-in and custom queries)
- Relational database design

## System Design

The system uses a relational structure with linked tables to ensure data integrity.  
Queries are used to retrieve, filter, and update trade related data efficiently.

## How to Run

1. Download this repository. 
2. Open the `.accdb` file using Microsoft Access.
3. Enable macros if prompted, and follow on-screen installation instructions.
4. Login using details from [User_Logins.md](User_Logins.md)

## About

This project was completed during Year 9 as my first database driven application. It marked my introduction to 
backend development skills and programming logic from my experience with frontend web development (HTML/CSS).

While core functionality is implemented, the system was not fully expanded to support seamless transaction linking
between users and markets. This experience motivated me to explore more scalable development environments, leading me to
begin working with JavaScript.
